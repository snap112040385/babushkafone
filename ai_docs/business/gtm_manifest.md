Go-to-Market Manifesto: Babushka Phone

1. ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
Russian diaspora professionals and entrepreneurs aged 25-45 who left Russia after 2022
We focus on Russian-speaking professionals (IT specialists, entrepreneurs, remote workers, business owners) who relocated abroad in the 2022-2025 emigration wave and earn between $2,000-6,000/month. These are:

IT professionals working remotely from Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Serbia, EU countries, Israel, or UAE
Entrepreneurs and business owners who maintain Russian business interests, properties, or investments
Professionals with families who have elderly parents remaining in Russia
Relocants who maintain swing status - regularly commuting between host country and Russia for business

They typically live in: Turkey (100K+), Kazakhstan (150K+), Georgia (100K+), Armenia (108K+), Serbia (150K+), Israel (75K+), Germany (500K+), UAE (20K+), and scattered across EU, North America, and Latin America.
Key demographic traits:

83% are aged 18-44
63% male, 37% female
High digital literacy
Most have NOT renounced Russian citizenship
Many maintain Russian assets, bank accounts, and property
45% experience banking problems abroad (blocked Russian cards)
14% are swing migrants who regularly commute back to Russia

2. Value Proposition
Current Workflow & Pain Points:
Russian diaspora professionals face a critical communication barrier: they cannot reliably call Russian institutions and businesses to manage their ongoing Russian obligations.
Daily/Weekly Pain Points:

2-4 hours/month dealing with Russian banks (blocked cards, verifications, fund transfers, mortgage payments) - cannot be done via messengers
1-2 hours/month calling Russian government offices (pension fund, property registration, tax authorities, notaries) - only accept phone calls
1-2 hours/month managing Russian property (utilities, repairs, property managers) - phone-only communication
Critical need for Russian phone numbers for 2FA verification (Sberbank, Tinkoff, Gosuslugi, etc.)
4-10 hours/month calling elderly family members who don't use smartphones or messengers

Current Broken Solutions:

WhatsApp/Telegram: Free but CANNOT call Russian landlines, businesses, or government offices
Skype: Blocked or unreliable in Russia
Traditional telco international: $0.50-2/minute ($30-120/hour) - prohibitively expensive
Existing VoIP services: $0.10-0.15/minute, but poor quality, no Russian interface, complex setup

Value Proposition:
"Babushka Phone helps Russian diaspora professionals by enabling them to maintain their Russian financial, legal, and family obligations from anywhere in the world - calling any Russian number reliably and affordably, directly from their browser, with Russian virtual numbers for 2FA."
