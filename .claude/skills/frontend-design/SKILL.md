## Overview

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic approach (minimalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft/pastel, industrial, etc.)
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: "What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?"

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both workвЂ”intentionality matters most.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Typography**: Choose distinctive, characterful fonts. Avoid generic options; pair compelling display fonts with refined body fonts.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to cohesive aesthetics. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. CSS-only for HTML; Motion library for React. Orchestrate page load reveals with staggered animations and scroll-triggered interactions.
- **Spatial Composition**: Employ unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements, and generous or controlled negative space.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere through gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

### What to Avoid

Never default to generic AI aesthetics: overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial), clichГ©d color schemes (purple gradients), predictable layouts, or cookie-cutter designs lacking context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices. Vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. Never converge on common choices across generations.

### Implementation Philosophy

"Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details."

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold backвЂ”show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
